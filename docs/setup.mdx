# Tiny Tales Part Two

"OK Lizabeth, I know who you need now, The World's Most Reckless inventoress!" Said Ruby.

"Which Inventoress is THAT?" Asked Lizabeth with a sly, small smile and looked past Ruby out the large, locked window.

Ruby held up a gold key and unlocked the window while never looking away from Lizabeth's eyes. Lizabeth gasped:

"Oh MY! Where did you steal that gold key? You rude, rooftop, pirate you!"

Ruby just smiled and pushed the glittering pink big button on her belly. Behind her back four shiny, red rotors unfolded like a ladybugs shells and wings. Ruby's short, muscular arms embraced Lizabeth's waist. The red rotors said:

"rrr-RRR-rrredirrrect!" Together they floated elegantly up, then glided out the window , up over the rooftop, behind a triple chimney and landed softly on a tiny terrace. A terrace filled with flowers and buzzing with bees.

# How we built a button for payment on the POW! page. With Stripe.
## I will start off with a message from my co-apprentice Lillian Raae-Vea (5 🦄):

Mom told dad and me:

"build me a bank card payment thingy on the POW! page. With Stripe. And you guys, make SURE it's properly encrypted."

Dad and me, we connected the Stripe API to the POW! page. Because Mom wanted us to "unlock" 🔓the stripe "window" with her test stripeKey 🔑.

This is what Dad told me to do:

## Tiny Tasks Part One

### Set up a (pretend) Gatsby site​ and add the StripeJS plugin

1.
Take out your sketchNote Book and your favorite pen or pencil. Open to a clean double page.
2.
Copy this into your sketchNote book to make your pretend "terminal 💀":

```
💀​                                       terminal 💀​
gatsby new pretend-site
​
​cd pretend-site​

​yarn add gatsby​-plugin-stripe

💀​                                       terminal 💀 ​over and out
```








Tiny Tasks Part Two
Borrow Benedicte's test stripeKey 🔑​to "unlock" 🔓​the stripe window
1.
Copy this into your sketchNote book to make your pretend "VS Code":

```

.                                       VS Code

1. ...
2. ...{
3.     ...
4.       ...stripe = window.Stripe("pk_test_XiirziufElakjoOpyuyCrPfo")
5.       //                         🔼 stripeKey 🔑   🔼
6.     }
7.     ... redirectToCheckout(event) {
8.       ...
9.       const { ... } = ... ....stripe.redirectToCheckout({
10.         ...,
11.         successUrl: `https://www.usepow.app/______`
12.         ...
13.       })
14.       if (...) {...("...:", ...)}
15.     }
16.     ...
17.      ...
18.       <button
19.         onClick={(event) => this.redirectToCheckout(event)}
20.       >
21.         Invest in POW! $54
22.       </button>
23. ...


                                       VS Code 💀​over and out

```

What does the stripeKey 🔑 do?
What does the redirectToCheckout() do?
