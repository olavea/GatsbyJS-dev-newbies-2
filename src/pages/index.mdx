# Playfuller Practice Makes POW!
GatsbyJS developer newbies is an open source and playful pack of tinyTales based on what we wonky webdev-interns do at POW! and in Lilly Labs while our CEO Benedicte @raae is doing her day job.

# What is this Week in Wonky Webdev Interns?
On the verge of going crazy from the unreal confusion and meaninglessness of studying React on his own. A reckless and rude BatCatDad gets hired in an internship with a learning curve from hell. And jumps into the start up world with his co-intern the playful pre-schooler Lillian (5 ðŸ¦„).

BUT when Lillian (5 ðŸ¦„) disappears during the Company Launch Party our heroic GatsbyJS developing BatCatDad must learn to code playfuller to
firstly connect to Lillian's time travel API and
secondly blend in with Lillian's piratical pre-Shakespearian actor-script-writer friends and join in their ridiculously risky rescue plan to outsmart the nerdy, but bloodthirsty Queen MARY the First.

The nerdy, but bloodthirsty Queen MARY the First is manipulated and backed by what is really just like any other ruthless Venture Investor who only wants his
ROI:
Revenge On Idiots:
A long list of personal enemies he wants to execute.

# Curious yet?
It only takes a few minutes to read the first tinyTale
