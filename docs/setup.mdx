## How to use useAuth

[`useAuth`](https://github.com/Swizec/useAuth) is designed to be quick to setup. You'll need an Auth0 account with an app domain and client id.

### 1. Install the hook

```
$ yarn add react-use-auth
or
$ npm i react-use-auth
```

Downloads from npm, adds to your package.json, etc.

### 2. Set up AuthProvider

useAuth uses an `AuthProvider` component to configure the Auth0 client and share state between components. It's using React context with a reducer behind the scenes, but that's an implementation detail.

I recommend adding this around your root component. In Gatsby that's done in `gatsby-browser.js` and `gatsby-ssr.js`. Yes `useAuth` is built so it doesn't break server-side rendering. ✌️

But of course server-side "you" will always be logged out.

```javascript
// gatsby-browser.js

import React from "react";
import { navigate } from "gatsby";

import { AuthProvider } from "react-use-auth";

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => (
    <AuthProvider
        navigate={navigate}
        auth0_domain="useauth.auth0.com"
        auth0_client_id="GjWNFNOHq1ino7lQNJBwEywa1aYtbIzh"
    >
        {element}
    </AuthProvider>
);
```

`<AuthProvider>` creates a context, sets up a state reducer, initializes an Auth0 client and so on. Everything you need for authentication to work in your whole app :)

The API takes a couple config options:

1. `navigate` – your navigation function, used for redirects. I've tested with Gatsby, but anything should work
2. `auth0_domain` – from your Auth0 app
3. `auth0_client_id` – from your Auth0 app
4. `auth0_params` – an object that lets you overwrite any of the default Auth0 client parameters

_PS: even though Auth doesn't do anything server-side, useAuth will throw errors during build, if its context doesn't exist_

#### Default Auth0 params

By default `useAuth`'s Auth0 client uses these params:

```javascript
const params = {
    domain: auth0_domain,
    clientID: auth0_client_id,
    redirectUri: `${callback_domain}/auth0_callback`,
    audience: `https://${auth0_domain}/api/v2/`,
    responseType: "token id_token",
    scope: "openid profile email"
};
```

`domain` and `clientID` come from your props.

`redirectUri` is set to use the `auth0_callback` page on the current domain. Auth0 redirects here after users login so you can set cookies and stuff. `useAuth` will handle this for you ✌️

`audience` is set to use api/v2. I know this is necessary but honestly have been copypasting it through several of my projects.

`responseType` same here. I copy paste this from old projects so I figured it's a good default.

`scope` you need `openid` for social logins and to be able to fetch user profiles after authentication. Profile and Email too. You can add more via the `auth0_params` override.

### 3. Create the callback page

Auth0 and most other authentication providers use OAuth. That requires redirecting your user to _their_ login form. After login, the provider redirects the user back to _your_ app.

Any way of creating React pages should work, here's what I use for Gatsby.

```javascript
// src/pages/auth0_callback

import React, { useEffect } from "react";

import { useAuth } from "react-use-auth";
import Layout from "../components/layout";

const Auth0CallbackPage = () => {
    const { handleAuthentication } = useAuth();
    useEffect(() => {
        handleAuthentication();
    }, []);

    return (
        <Layout>
            <h1>
                This is the auth callback page, you should be redirected
                immediately.
            </h1>
        </Layout>
    );
};

export default Auth0CallbackPage;
```

The goal is to load a page, briefly show some text, and run the `handleAuthentication` method from `useAuth` on page load.

That method will create a cookie in local storage with your user's information and redirect back to the homepage by default.

To redirect to a route other than the homepage after the user is logged in, supply the `handleAuthentication` function an Object Literal with the `postLoginRoute` key and an associated route value. For example, to route to `/account`, call `handleAuthentication` as follows:

```javascript
handleAuthentication({ postLoginRoute: "/account" });
```

**_PS: Make sure you add `<domain>/auth0_callback` as a valid callback URL in your Auth0 config_**
